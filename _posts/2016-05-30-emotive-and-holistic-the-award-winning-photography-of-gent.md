Emotive and Holistic. The award-winning photography of Gent Ng strives to create images that can be felt from the heart and be played in the mind as scenes from a feature film. 

An award-winning photographer with a diverse portfolio whose select work has been featured on-line (One Model Place). Shooting since 1998, Gent's creative work involves a variety of photography, including events, wedding, fashion, portraits, editorial and architectural.

When not involved in commercial work, Gent volunteers his time in the community snapping photos of the many people who work hard towards a better Vancouver for all.
